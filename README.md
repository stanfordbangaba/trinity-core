An integrated banking system software for web and mobile

This is a project I am using to learn new technologies.  It will consist of a Java EE (version 7 as of this writing) back end 
and admin front-end.  The client front-end will be implemented in HTML 5 and JavaScript (AngularJS) consuming REST services.

More information to be added as I integrate with more technologies (Akka, Kafka, Spark etc).
